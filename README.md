  8. This one would not show up except under my profile/solutions. Here is my code:
          import collections
            def find_it(seq):
                if len(seq) == 0:
                    return None
                b = collections.Counter(seq)
                for position in b:
                    if b[position] %2 == 1:
                        return position

 Short Summary:
 I enjoyed working on the codewars problems. Before this project, I was not a fan of Python, which is why I
 wanted to use python. Also, the homework with the raspberry pi inspired me to want to learn more. After this
 project, I feel that I know enough python to get done what I need to get done, and then maybe a little bit more.
 In codewars, I am at 6kyu and I have 126 Kata
